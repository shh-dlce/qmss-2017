This is a short tutorial on how to use R.  

This format indicates that the text is R code:

```{r eval=F}
2 + 16
```

This format indicates that the text is the output of running some code:

```{r echo=F}
2 + 16
```

# Starting out

First, you need to download and install R ([from here](http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/misc/cran/), I'm using version 3.2.2, but you should install the latest version, or at least check you have version 3 or above).

We will be using RStudio to interface with R (download it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/)).  The program looks something like this (the position of each window might be different for you):

In the upper left is the console - you can type in R arguments here and press enter to run them.  On the top right is the script window.  You can save R scripts here and run lines from them (Control + Enter).  On the bottom right is a space for displaying plots and help, and on the bottom right there is a space for displaying what objects are in the memory at the moment.

For a basic introduction to the RStudio program, you could check out a short youtube video like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YmcEYTSN7k).

# Basic assignment

You can run commands in R in two ways.

First, type the following into the console window and hit enter:

```{r}
3 + 4
```

You should get the response above.  The second way is to write code in a script file, and then send lines from there to the console window.  I reccommend the second option, because it makes editing previous lines easier, and you have a record of what you did.

There's an example of an R script in [this file](RScriptExample.R).

Let's make a new script.  Click File > New File > R script.  A blank script should appear in the script window.

The first thing we can do is to add a note at the start of the file to say what it's about.  Any text after a hashtag will be ignored by R - these are called *comments*, and are useful for explaining our code to others (and ourselves!).  

So we can add the following line at the top of the file (including the hashtag at the start):

```{r}
# My first R script
```


You can assign values to variables with the assignment operator **<-**.  Type this into the script window on a new line (each new line is a new command):

```{r}
x <- 4
```

Then place your cursor on the line you just typed, and click the `Run` button in the script window (or press Control + Enter).  The line of code should appear in the console window, and in the 'Environment' window you should see a listing for `x` appear.

`x` is now a **variable** which stores the number 4.  

(Note: Some programming languages make a distinction between integer and continuous numbers, but R does not differentiate.)

We can look at the value of `x` by running:

```{r}
x
```

Variables can have any name, with a few restrictions:

* They can't include special characters (parentheses + - / * etc.)
* They don't include spaces (you can use `.` or `_`, e.g. `my.variable` or `my_variable`)
* They are case sensitive (so `x` would be different to `X`)

Ideally, the name of the variable should make it obvious what it stores.

You can run operations on this variable, like adding, dividing or multiplying:

```{r}
x + 1
x - 3
x / 2
x * 3
```


Note that the output shows a `[1]`.  You can ignore this - it's there because R likes to do things with sequences.  The code below creates a list of numbers from 1 to 40.  If we run it, we see that the numbers in brackets just help us keep track of how many items are in the sequence:

```{r}
1:40
```

Let's make a list of numbers.  To do that, we use the *combine* function `c`:

```{r}
nums <- c(1,4,5,5,3)
```

This is called a **numeric vector**.  It's an ordered sequence of numbers.  We can also run operations on this variable:

```{r}
nums *2
```

Note that the operation applies to each item in the list.

Some **functions** can also be used with numeric vectors, for example getting the sum of the items.  `sum` is a function which takes one *argument* (a numeric vector), and returns the sum of all the items in that argument.

```{r}
sum(nums)
```

The funciton `length` takes one argument (a numeric vector), and returns the length of the vector:

```{r}
length(nums)
```


We can also make a **character vector** which is just an ordered sequence of strings:

```{r}
number.names <- c("one",'two','three','four','five')
```

Individual strings can be surrounded by single or double qutotes, as long as they match up.

You can't use numeric operators with character vectors, but you can use other functions.  `nchar` is a function that takes a single argument (a charater vector) and returns the number of characters in each item:

```{r}
nchar(number.names)
```

# Indexing

There are three ways to index items in vectors:

* by index number
* with a boolean vector
* by name


## Indexing by index number

What is the first item in the vector `nums`?  We can access it by indexing the vector:

```{r}
nums[1]
nums[3]
```

Note that **indexing in R starts from 1** (asking for item 0 will return an empty item).  

We can also extract several items at a time.  Here, we ask for the first three items of `nums`

```{r}
nums[c(1,2,3)]
```

Note that, in R, sequentially ordered numbers can be quickly made using the colon operator:

```{r}
nums[1:3]
nums[2:4]
nums[3:1]
```

## Indexing with a boolean vector

A boolean vector is a sequence of True and False values.  For example:

```{r}
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

You can pass boolean vectors to some funcitons.  For example, `sum` will return the number of `TRUE` values:

```{r}
sum(y)
```


> **Task**: can you apply the functions `sum` and `length` to boolean vectors?

You can use a boolean vector to index another vector:

```{r}
nums[y]
```

This returns each item in `nums`, as long as the corresponding item in `y` is `TRUE`.

This is useful because boolean values can be generated by applying logical operators to vectors.  

```{r}
nums > 3
```

This returned a boolean vector where each item was `TRUE` if the corresponding item in `nums` was greater than 3.

Here are some logical operators:

* `>` : greater than
* `<` : less than
* `>=` : greater or equal to
* `<=` : less or equal to
* `==` : is equal to (note *two* equals signs)
* `!=` : is *not* equal to

> **Task**: make a list of booleans where the items are `TRUE` if each corresponding item of `nums` is less or equal to 3

Now we can use a boolean vector to index another vector.  For example, this code returns the items of `nums` where `nums` is greater than 3.

```{r}
nums[nums > 3]
```

It's worth spending some time understanding how indexing works, because it's used often.

Another useful operator is `%in%`.  It tests whether items in the vector before it exist in the vector after it:

```{r}
AshleyFaveNums <- c(1,3,5,7,9)
BrettFaveNums <- c(4,5,2,3)
BrettFaveNums %in% AshleyFaveNums
```

> **Task**: make a list of booleans where the items are `TRUE` if each corresponding item of `nums` is either 5 or 1.

```{r include =F}
nums %in% c(5,1)
```


> **Task **: Using y to index `nums` worked because the length of the two vectors are the same.  What happens if you make another variable `y2` which only has 3 boolean items, and try to index `nums` using that?

```{r include=F}
y2 = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
nums[y2]
```

## Indexing by name

Data structures can recieve names.  For example, our `nums` variable could be the favourite numbers of our friends.  We can create a character vector of our friends' names, then set this as the names of the items in `nums`.

```{r}
friends = c("Ashley","Brett","Casey","Drew","Emery")
names(nums) = friends
nums
```

Now that each item in `nums` has a name, we can index `nums` by name:
```{r}
nums["Brett"]
nums[c("Brett","Casey")]
```

> **Task**:  Find the favourite numbers of all my friends who have more than 4 characters in their name.
> 
> Hint: build this up step by step.  First of all, get the number of characters in each name, then test whether this number is greater than 4.  This should result in a vector of booleans.  Then index nums using this vector.

```{r include=F}
nums[nchar(friends)>4]
```
